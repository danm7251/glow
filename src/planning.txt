A lot of design questions to consider:
    -   The code block that sets the edit flag has access to the song but the edit block does not.
        This poses the question of how to track/reference songs as we need to mutate the struct and do not want to mutate a cloned version.
        Upgrades to the songs vector may be needed. One option is a unique song_id, perhaps creating a Library struct to manage them but it feels overcomplicated.

    -   Disparities between the tags and title displayed need to be accounted for. Can we avoid redundacy in having a tag title and a display title?

    -   Huge amounts of error handling need addressing

    -   Design review and overhaul

    -   Project structure needs a review

    -   Is the buffer truly the best solution

    -   Huge WIP
